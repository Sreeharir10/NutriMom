    "Key Vitamins & Minerals": "Iron (0.2 mg), Folate (3 mcg)",
    "Pregnancy Benefits": "Provides essential carbohydrates for energy, supporting the second trimester's increased needs. The iron content helps manage anemia, especially when paired with vitamin C-rich foods. Folate is crucial for fetal development, particularly in the second trimester.",
    "Risks": "High glycemic index may impact blood sugar management, potentially worsening hypertension. Limited fiber and protein content necessitate balanced pairing with other nutrients to avoid excessive weight gain.",
    "Best Ways to Eat": "Pair with non-vegetarian protein sources like chicken or fish for iron synergy. Incorporate vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., tomatoes) to enhance iron absorption. Add vegetables for fiber and prepare without over-rinsing to retain nutrients."
